(MARS PROBLEM)
Time Complexity
The time complexity is O(n) because it is dependant on looping through every character in the string of size n. Although there is another for loop to test the current characters against SOS, it only does 3 checks for every char in the string, and O(3n) = O(n)
Space Complexity
The space complexity would be O(c) or constant space complexity because it updates the same variables and even the string that it updates will only every reach up to 3 characters.
